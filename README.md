# Fire-Detection-using-HAAR-Cascade-Classifier-in-OpenCV
This repo contains code that will detect fire in the room using live feed from a camera. The portion of the image with fire will be highlighted in red. We have used HAAR cascade classifier to classify the images as positives and negatives. Classifier has been trained using OpenCV on command line on a Windows 10 machine.
